# weekend_03_API_challenge

This folder contains files relating to Prime's 3rd weekend challenge. We were tasked to find an API and demonstrate a use for it. I choose a stock quote API from Markit On Demand and placed it in the site I have been using for previous demonstrations.

The files included in this folder are:

index.html: my custom HTML file

script.js: my custom JS file

stylesheet.css: my custom CSS file

jquery.min.js: jquery minified file

jquery.spectrum.js: js file for the spectrum plugin

spectrum-plugin folder: spectrum plugin additional information

bootstrap.min.css: bootstrap minified file



3-4 ideas for future use:
stock ticker app
find your specific stock information
incorporate a symbol lookup finder as well to make it more well-rounded
maybe it could store your stock preferences and update their quotes automatically everyday
